# Feedback Intelligence Agent – Product Specification (v1)  
  
## Purpose  
Build an agentic feedback-intelligence system that continuously aggregates signals across channels, interprets explicit user intent, detects momentum, and recommends what to prioritize.  
  
Pump is used as an initial GTM wedge, not as the product itself.  
  
## Core Principles  
- Explicit intent over inferred sentiment  
- Prioritization over observation  
- Agentic loops over dashboards  
- Read-only integrations  
- Human-in-the-loop actions
